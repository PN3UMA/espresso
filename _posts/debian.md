At work the other day, I eyed what appeared to be a perfectly good laptop -- granted a dinasour -- on the floor topped by a piece of paper with the word "Trash" scrawled on it. Right then and there, I said if this boots up, "I'm taking it." I plugged it in, powered it on and it booted up into Windows 10. Snatch!

My newfound discovery is a Toshiba Tecra A10 that dates back to 2009. Weighing in at a whopping 2.8 kg (~ 6 lb.), it is a bit on the hefty side. It's the kind of laptop you see in the front of police cruisers: thick, grey and bulky. The promotional material said it was targeted toward a corporate market. The original $1200 asking price bears that out. 

Back in the day, this particular machine was running Windows Vista Business but had since been upgraded to Windows 10. It features a 15.4" TFT display, an Intel Centrino 2.5 GHz dual-core processor, 2 GB of RAM, 64 GB HDD. Not the worst, not the best. 

**Ports galore** Two USB type C ports, a 3.5 mm headphone jack and that's it. What's the point of a sleaker chassis if I'm just going to have multiple dongles hanging out from the sides?

Since I was trying to ditch Windows ASAP, I mulled over which distro to install. As I mentioned in my previous post, XFCE is a lightweight desktop environment good for older systems, so that was the easy part. I was pretty much set on Xubuntu, but since this was going to be installed onto the system raw and not just a live USB, I did a little more research. In doing so, I discovered that, based on [benchmark testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xubuntu#Performance), Xubuntu consumed nearly twiced the RAM as Debian with XFCE. 

**Taking off the Training Wheels**

Running and maintaining Debian is a continuation in my journey to dig deeper into Linux. Linux has evolved exponentially in its nearly 30 years of existence. Gone are the days of [**Slackware**] and , when you had to build and compile everything from source. Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu which is based on Debian. Running Debian cuts out a lot of middlemen. I don't think I'll ever be that guy that's running minimal Arch Linux with a tiling window manager. I don't want to be.

When system resources are limited, managing them wisely is all the more important. How much of what I do can be outsourced to the cloud?
